## Health Disinformation/Misinformation (Swire-Thompson et al., 2020)
- Health misinformation is defines as nformation that is contrary to the epistemic consensus of the scientific community regarding a phenomenon. What is considered true and false is constantly changing as new evidence comes to light and as techniques and methods are advanced  
- Disinformation vs. misinformation: Disinformation is a coordinated or deliberate effort to knowingly circulate misinformation in order to gain money, power, or reputation. Teasing apart disinformation and misinformation can be extremely difficult, giving that intent behind a message is not always transparent or constant from messenger to messenger. 
- Example: The popular misconception that sugar causes hyperactivity in children. 
- Health misinformation engagement:
    * Direct to online sources
    * Search: Confirmation bias - people can selectively expose themselves to evidence that support prior beliefs
    * User-generated content: Some of the platforms appear to be more permeable to misinformation than others. Sites that are generally considered credible sources of health informaiton are vulnerable to misinformation. 
    * Mobile apps
- How health misinformation spreads: 
    * False information diffused farther, faster and deeper because the content was more novel and elicited more disgust, fear, and surprise. 
    * Individuals and corporations with large social media audiences have a greater responsbility to check that health information they are sharing is correct. 
- Who is spreading misinformation? - 1% of individuals saw 80% of the fake news sources, and just 0.1% of individuals shared 80% fake news sources. 
- Echo chamber: Individuals have an information diet that reinforces their worldview and extremist is exacerbated. 
- Consequences: 
    * Quality of health information online cannot be guaranteed. 
    * People are more attracted to unaccredited source and less scientific quality. 
    * Concern: Public trust in both reputable and disreputable media sources decreases simultaneously and individuals struggle to distinguish between the two. 
- How to tackle health misinformation?
    * Improve eHealth Literacy
    * Using the internet collaborateively with physicians
    * Stronger signal of source quality 
    * Creating and distribution of accurate information
    * Increased frequency of corrections
    * Taking advantage of technology (tools can communicate health advice in real time)
 
## Examination of Gender Stereotypes and Norms in Health-Related Content Posted to Snapchat Discover Channels: Qualitative Content Analysis (LeBeau et al., 2019)
Snapchat has seen one of the most rapid, and unprecedented, growths in the history of social networking sites and social media with 3 billion Snapchats sent daily. In 2015, Snapchat introduced a new feature, Snapchat Discover, providing a unique way for publishers, such as magazines, to connect their content to Snapchat users.
This study aimed to evaluate qualitatively the health-related content distributed among male-focused and female-focused Discover channels and to determine whether differences exist between the content posted to these channels.
Magazine Discover channels with male and female target audiences were identified based on the magazine’s claimed audience and a search of Snapchat Discover’s magazine publishers, resulting in the selection of two male-focused and two female-focused channels. Stories were collected daily from each of the selected channels during a 4-week period. Using the constant comparative method, 406 Discover stories were collected and analyzed.
=> Differences in health content coverage existed between male- and female-focused channels. General health stories from male channels comprised 7.5% (10/134) of total stories compared with 22.8% (62/272) for female channels. Sexual health stories from male channels comprised 3.0% (4/134) of total stories compared with 18.8% (51/272) for female channels. Moreover, female-focused channels’ content was more comprehensive. Female audiences were portrayed as being health information seekers, concerned with sexual health and male satisfaction, primarily responsible for contraception and pregnancy prevention, and less informed about sex. Male audiences were portrayed as being less likely to seek health information, obsessed with and driven by sex, and less concerned with sexual health.
### Note
- In seeking for articles that relate gender stereotypes with health information, majority of research focuses on investigating how gender stereotype affects the intention and behavior of seeking health information in male and female individuals.

## Gender stereotypes in Facebook profiles: Are women more female online? (Oberst et al., 2016)
Results indicate that users present themselves in a less gender stereotypical way online, and that women do so more than males; altered self-presentation on Facebook influenced personal well-being, but to a lesser degree than other factors; finally, high intensity Facebook use showed a negative effect on well-being.

## Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage 2023
https://immunizationdata.who.int/global/wiise-detail-page/human-papillomavirus-(hpv)-vaccination-coverage?ANTIGEN=&YEAR=&CODE=
- Geographical disparities
- Male coverage (voluntary) is lower than female
- Many missing data (e.g., Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, the U.S., Australia etc.)

## HPV & the importance of HPV vaccines
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/human-papilloma-virus-and-cancer
https://www.who.int/activities/immunizing-against-hpv
- Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection which is connected to various cancers and genital warts. Among over 200 types of HPV, many of them are harmless and go away on their own, but some high-risk types can cause significant health problems, such as cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, head and neck.
- HPV vaccine can effectively prevent infections from the most harmful types of HPV, particularly types 16 and 18, which account for over 70% of cervical cancer instances. 
- It is recommended that girls aged 9 to 14 should get the HPV vaccine because it is most impactful when administered before individuals get sexually active.
- Cervical cancer is the most serious long-term consequence of HPV infection. HPV vaccination is considered a highly cost-effective public health tool to eradicate it globally, especially in less developed areas where the illness is most prevalent while screening and treatment are scarce.​

## Identifying False Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Information and Corresponding Risk Perceptions From Twitter: Advanced Predictive Models
9 Sep 2021
https://www.jmir.org/2021/9/e30451/
- Misinformation poses risks that can be exacerbated by social media. People may become victims of the spread of false health information due to a lack of health literacy and the inability to assess reliability. The quality of health news is also inconsistent, regardless of the sources used. To reduce the risks associated with misinformation, it is critical to identify it before it spreads.
- The study showed that false HPV vaccine information and risk perceptions on Twitter (corpus in English from Dec 2013 to Dec 2017) could be successfully detected by applying machine learning and NLP to create a number of classification models and causality mining techniques. In particular, the convolutional neural network model (CNN) performed the best among all models, with an F score of 91.95. 
- Overall, people talked about the advantages or low risk of harms in the true HPV vaccination tweets and different negative impacts in the false information tweets. According to research, false information primarily consisted of loss-framed messages about the possible risks of vaccines covering many subjects (e.g., infertility, neurological disorders, child developmental disorders, and death). These tweets typically used a wider range of vocabulary as well. True information, on the other hand, included both gain-framed messages (e.g., preventing cancer linked to HPV infection and denying the risk of increased unprotected sexual behaviour of the vaccinated teenagers) and loss-framed messages that focused on the effectiveness of vaccines covering fewer topics. Besides, those tweets used a relatively limited vocabulary.
- These findings are consistent with previous related literature. One possible explanation for the disparity is that true information requires evidence-based language, which limits the vocabulary size. In contrast, false tweets are more likely to use narrative language or introduce new subjects to attract attention.

## Exploring content of misinformation about HPV vaccine on twitter
27 Jul 2022
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10865-022-00342-1
- A study of 3876 distinct English tweets from December 15, 2019, to March 31, 2020, revealed that 24% of them contained dis-/misinformation. 
- In line with earlier research, audience engagement against vaccines is higher than that in favour of them (measured by the total number of likes, retweets, and replies). Tweets that contain personal narratives, are ambiguous, and are not age or gender specific increase audience engagement.
- The most common categories of dis-/misinformation were adverse health effects (59%), mandatory vaccination (19%), and inefficacy of the vaccine (14%). Among the adverse health effects Tweets, non-specific harm/injury (51%) and death (23%) were the most frequent. 
- Types of concern: health, safety, pharma, government, common concerns, mandatory, ineffective, vague, and other.

## Detecting and monitoring concerns against HPV vaccination on social media using large language models
21 Jun 2024
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64703-3
- After examining 653k tweets about HPV between Jan 2020 and Jun 2022, the main themes were vaccine mandates, adverse effects, and personal anecdotes. Nearly 50% of the sample expressed concern. 
- The trend in tweets has shifted from pre-2020 to personal stories of vaccine-related harm, with an increasing demand for parental approval and openness.
- About 80% of the topic labelling performed by GPT-4 was manually marked as “(somewhat) appropriate”, although it tended to over-generalise.

## Some observations:
- Most past research studies only English social media posts.
- Much literature is based on the U.S. data.

## Some possible limitations/considerations:
- Single platform
- Representative?
- Differentiate between misinformation & disinformation
- The number of followers can also affect audience engagement 

## Social and cultural construction processes involved in HPV vaccine hesitancy among Chinese women: a qualitative study
18 Sep 2019
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12939-019-1052-9

Stereotypes:
- The vaccine is exclusively for women.
- Confusion/inter-relationship between HPV and HIV.
- The causation between being promiscuous (having many sexual partners or indulging in frequent sexual activities) & cervical cancer incidence.
- Inefficacy of the HPV vaccine if there is already sexual experience.
- Unawareness of the risk of cervical cancer and the necessity of vaccination for the non-vaccinated people with no gynaecological conditions in their family or social network.
- Suspicion of the commercial intention by doctors (doctors, sickness, treatment > doctors, preventive care).
- HPV vaccine is likely to encourage immoral, promiscuous, and dangerous sexual behaviour as vaccinated women might not be afraid of cervical cancer anymore. 
- The vaccine can cause death and paralysis (or some unknown side effects).
