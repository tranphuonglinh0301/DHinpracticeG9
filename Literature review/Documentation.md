## Health Disinformation/Misinformation (Swire-Thompson et al., 2020)
- Health misinformation is defines as nformation that is contrary to the epistemic consensus of the scientific community regarding a phenomenon. What is considered true and false is constantly changing as new evidence comes to light and as techniques and methods are advanced  
- Disinformation vs. misinformation: Disinformation is a coordinated or deliberate effort to knowingly circulate misinformation in order to gain money, power, or reputation. Teasing apart disinformation and misinformation can be extremely difficult, giving that intent behind a message is not always transparent or constant from messenger to messenger. 
- Example: The popular misconception that sugar causes hyperactivity in children. 
- Health misinformation engagement:
    * Direct to online sources
    * Search: Confirmation bias - people can selectively expose themselves to evidence that support prior beliefs
    * User-generated content: Some of the platforms appear to be more permeable to misinformation than others. Sites that are generally considered credible sources of health informaiton are vulnerable to misinformation. 
    * Mobile apps
- How health misinformation spreads: 
    * False information diffused farther, faster and deeper because the content was more novel and elicited more disgust, fear, and surprise. 
    * Individuals and corporations with large social media audiences have a greater responsbility to check that health information they are sharing is correct. 
- Who is spreading misinformation? - 1% of individuals saw 80% of the fake news sources, and just 0.1% of individuals shared 80% fake news sources. 
- Echo chamber: Individuals have an information diet that reinforces their worldview and extremist is exacerbated. 
- Consequences: 
    * Quality of health information online cannot be guaranteed. 
    * People are more attracted to unaccredited source and less scientific quality. 
    * Concern: Public trust in both reputable and disreputable media sources decreases simultaneously and individuals struggle to distinguish between the two. 
- How to tackle health misinformation?
    * Improve eHealth Literacy
    * Using the internet collaborateively with physicians
    * Stronger signal of source quality 
    * Creating and distribution of accurate information
    * Increased frequency of corrections
    * Taking advantage of technology (tools can communicate health advice in real time)
 
## Examination of Gender Stereotypes and Norms in Health-Related Content Posted to Snapchat Discover Channels: Qualitative Content Analysis (LeBeau et al., 2019)
Snapchat has seen one of the most rapid, and unprecedented, growths in the history of social networking sites and social media with 3 billion Snapchats sent daily. In 2015, Snapchat introduced a new feature, Snapchat Discover, providing a unique way for publishers, such as magazines, to connect their content to Snapchat users.
This study aimed to evaluate qualitatively the health-related content distributed among male-focused and female-focused Discover channels and to determine whether differences exist between the content posted to these channels.
Magazine Discover channels with male and female target audiences were identified based on the magazine’s claimed audience and a search of Snapchat Discover’s magazine publishers, resulting in the selection of two male-focused and two female-focused channels. Stories were collected daily from each of the selected channels during a 4-week period. Using the constant comparative method, 406 Discover stories were collected and analyzed.
=> Differences in health content coverage existed between male- and female-focused channels. General health stories from male channels comprised 7.5% (10/134) of total stories compared with 22.8% (62/272) for female channels. Sexual health stories from male channels comprised 3.0% (4/134) of total stories compared with 18.8% (51/272) for female channels. Moreover, female-focused channels’ content was more comprehensive. Female audiences were portrayed as being health information seekers, concerned with sexual health and male satisfaction, primarily responsible for contraception and pregnancy prevention, and less informed about sex. Male audiences were portrayed as being less likely to seek health information, obsessed with and driven by sex, and less concerned with sexual health.
### Note
- In seeking for articles that relate gender stereotypes with health information, majority of research focuses on investigating how gender stereotype affects the intention and behavior of seeking health information in male and female individuals.

## Gender stereotypes in Facebook profiles: Are women more female online? (Oberst et al., 2016)
Results indicate that users present themselves in a less gender stereotypical way online, and that women do so more than males; altered self-presentation on Facebook influenced personal well-being, but to a lesser degree than other factors; finally, high intensity Facebook use showed a negative effect on well-being.
