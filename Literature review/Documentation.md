## Health Disinformation/Misinformation (Swire-Thompson et al., 2020)
- Health misinformation is defines as nformation that is contrary to the epistemic consensus of the scientific community regarding a phenomenon. What is considered true and false is constantly changing as new evidence comes to light and as techniques and methods are advanced  
- Disinformation vs. misinformation: Disinformation is a coordinated or deliberate effort to knowingly circulate misinformation in order to gain money, power, or reputation. Teasing apart disinformation and misinformation can be extremely difficult, giving that intent behind a message is not always transparent or constant from messenger to messenger. 
- Example: The popular misconception that sugar causes hyperactivity in children. 
- Health misinformation engagement:
    * Direct to online sources
    * Search: Confirmation bias - people can selectively expose themselves to evidence that support prior beliefs
    * User-generated content: Some of the platforms appear to be more permeable to misinformation than others. Sites that are generally considered credible sources of health informaiton are vulnerable to misinformation. 
    * Mobile apps
- How health misinformation spreads: 
    * False information diffused farther, faster and deeper because the content was more novel and elicited more disgust, fear, and surprise. 
    * Individuals and corporations with large social media audiences have a greater responsbility to check that health information they are sharing is correct. 
- Who is spreading misinformation? - 1% of individuals saw 80% of the fake news sources, and just 0.1% of individuals shared 80% fake news sources. 
- Echo chamber: Individuals have an information diet that reinforces their worldview and extremist is exacerbated. 
- Consequences: 
    * Quality of health information online cannot be guaranteed. 
    * People are more attracted to unaccredited source and less scientific quality. 
    * Concern: Public trust in both reputable and disreputable media sources decreases simultaneously and individuals struggle to distinguish between the two. 
- How to tackle health misinformation?
    * Improve eHealth Literacy
    * Using the internet collaborateively with physicians
    * Stronger signal of source quality 
    * Creating and distribution of accurate information
    * Increased frequency of corrections
    * Taking advantage of technology (tools can communicate health advice in real time)
