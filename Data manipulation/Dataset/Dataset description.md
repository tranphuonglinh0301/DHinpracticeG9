# Dataset description
The data processing was conducted using both Python and R, with each tool serving distinct purposes. Python was primarily employed for formatting-related tasks such as reformatting, pseudo-anonymization and language detection, while R was utilized to explore the structure and basic characteristics of the dataset. 
A major issue with the dataset stemmed from its format. Specifically, the CSV reader was unable to differentiate between new line characters signifying new rows and those within individual tweets. To address this, all new line characters were initially removed. Since the new line character marking a new row consistently appeared before the timestamp, a regular expression was applied to detect the timestamp pattern and insert new line characters accordingly. Additionally, while most CSV readers can distinguish between commas within double quotes and those used as delimiters, this dataset did not allow for such differentiation. To streamline processing, the delimiter was semi-manually changed to a semicolon. During this step, the dataset was manually reviewed to ensure the accuracy of each data point.
To pseudo-anonymize data, the “hashlib” library was used to assign a unique code to each username. Subsequently, columns containing sensitive information, such as full names, profile URLs, and profile pictures, were removed from the dataframe. This approach allowed researchers to identify whether two tweets were authored by the same user while preserving anonymity. For language detection, the “langdetect” library was employed. A function was developed to identify the language of each tweet, which was then appended to a new column labeled “language.” The dataset was subsequently filtered to retain only tweets written in English, Italian, and French.
In R, engagement-related columns were transformed into numeric values for analysis. A new column, “engagement,” was created to calculate the cumulative sum of likes, quotes, replies and retweets for each tweet. Using the library “ggplot2”, a column plot was generated to compare the average engagement across the three languages (Figure 1). The results indicated that tweets written in French had the highest average engagement scores, surpassing those written in English and Italian.
